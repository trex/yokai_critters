## Designing New Levels (tilemaps)
The levels are desigined using the [Tiled map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/), 
which runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.  Tiled enables creating tilemaps with 
embedable meta-data (collision boundaries on walls, player start location, etc),
creation of tilesets from images, and animated tile layers. 

Tileset meta-data that is commonly used throughout this project must be declared 
specifically (case-senstive) as documented.
